### `"prestart": "pnpm build",`

- The prestart script is a special script in npm that gets automatically run before the start script when you run npm start.
- This is a feature of npm and yarn, but pnpm does not support these automatic pre and post scripts.
- In pnpm, if you want to run a command before start, you would have to explicitly call it.
